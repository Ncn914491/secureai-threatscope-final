                    # This is a simplified example. In a real app, you'd get an ID token
                    # from the client-side Firebase SDK and verify it here.
                    # For a pure Streamlit app without client-side JS, direct email/password
                    # login with Admin SDK is not the standard Firebase auth flow for end-users.
                    # The Admin SDK is typically used to manage users or verify tokens.
                    #
                    # A common pattern for web apps is:
                    # 1. User signs in on the client-side (e.g., using Firebase JS SDK).
                    # 2. Client gets an ID token.
                    # 3. Client sends ID token to the backend (Streamlit app).
                    # 4. Backend (Streamlit) verifies the ID token using Admin SDK.
                    #
                    # Since Streamlit doesn't easily support client-side JS for this,
                    # we'll simulate a verification step. For a real app, consider
                    # integrating with Firebase Web (JS) or using a different auth method
                    # if you must do everything server-side without custom components.

                    # Placeholder for actual user lookup if using custom token verification
                    # user = firebase_auth.get_user_by_email(email)
                    # For now, we'll assume if we reach here, the login is "successful"
                    # in a conceptual sense, but this isn't secure for real email/password.
                    #
                    # A more direct (but less common for web frontends) approach for some use cases:
                    # If you were building a CLI or a backend service that needs to *act as* a user,
                    # you might use custom tokens, but that's not for typical user login.

                    # For a pure Streamlit app, you might consider:
                    # - Using a simpler auth mechanism if Firebase Web isn't an option.
                    # - Building a Streamlit custom component to handle Firebase JS login.
                    # - Using a pre-built Streamlit Firebase auth component if one exists.
